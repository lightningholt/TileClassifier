This repository is the public facing repository of the collaboration between LightningHolt LLC, CloudSmiths LLC, and Fractals Research LLC. It is available in conjunction
with a publication on PLOS One. 

Very generally, this repo is designed to use a CNN to associate images that have repeated motifs at various lengths scales with each other. 
More specifically, this repo is designed to identify the characteristic signatures of artists who paint in an "all-over" style. 
For more details, please see the publication in PLOS.
